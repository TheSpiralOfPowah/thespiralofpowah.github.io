<h1>Goodbye, cruel github!</h1>
<p>
    So, I'm leaving github pages in favor of Vercel. They have free servers, so I can do all of the gooberly things I want there without needing to pay up. But no fancy vercel URL just yet. In the mean time, think about the things that WILL be there.
    
    - Better looks!
    - Free donation methods like Ad Wall, or Pay with Time.
    - âˆ…-kens: A kind of Tokens which you can get by donating (this includes the free donation method), or buying anything from my website.
    - An actual backend!
    - API features that you may or may not find useful!
