<h1>Hang on just a sec!</h1>
<p>
    This website is currently undergoing MAJOR reworking. Expect to see nothing cool for a while... except for a roadmap!!!

    - Better looks!
    - Free donation methods like Ad Wall, or Pay with Time.
    - âˆ…-kens: A kind of Tokens which you can get by donating (this includes the free donation method), or buying anything from my website.
    - An actual backend!
    - API features that you may or may not find useful!

    But there's a problem. I can't afford backends. So, I've developed a scheme.
    Instead of using a standard backend, I'll use the discord bot API to use a discord server as a real server! Genius.
